# Front End 1 Week 6 Assignment Directions

Now you know how to create webpages using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You also know how to use links between pages, Bootstrap and fetching data.

In this Assignment we are going to create an **Student Enrollment program**,
The program Allows the new and currents students Enroll to Different courses but **no more than 4 courses per student and no more than 3 students per course** also the student's status must be active to Enroll in a new course.

Yes as you read before NEW AND CURRENT students. Wich means the program allows the user to register a new student in the database (if the student is not registered)in order to enroll them in a course. You will get current students data fetching the link below.

All right ... so the question is how the program works?
The Index.html file has 3 buttons: Students, Courses and New_Estudent

**If the user clicks "Students":** the program display the list of all students with their information
* name
* last last
* green circle if the student's status is active. Nothing if is not active
* enrolled curses
* 'edit' button (allow to change student information)
* 'add course' button (add another curse)

This is an Example
<img src = "./images/students.png"/>


**If the user clicks "Courses":** the program display the list of courses with their information
* name
* duration
* students (the students enrolled in that course)
* 'add student' button (enroll another student to that course)

This is an Example
<img src = "./images/courses.png"/>


**If the user clicks "New Student":** the program allows the user to register a new student to the data base and enroll them to a new course
